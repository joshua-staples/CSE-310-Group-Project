# Mindful Homework WebApp
Mindful is a webapp that is designed to help students schedule their time better for homework. Our approach streamlines the homework session experience. 

We use the Canvas API to pull a students assignments and present them in a minimal distraction free interface.

Our goal is to help students be more mindful about how they do their homework. To facilitate this goal we build a dedicated mindfulness page to help them relax and take meaningful study breaks.
